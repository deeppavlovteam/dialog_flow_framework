# First of all, to create a dialog agent, we need to create a dialog script.
# Below, `flows` is the dialog script.
# A dialog script is a flow dictionary that can contain multiple flows .
# Flows are needed in order to divide a dialog into sub-dialogs and process them separately.
# For example, the separation can be tied to the topic of the dialog.
# In our example, there is one flow called greeting_flow.

# Inside each flow, we can describe a sub-dialog using keyword `GRAPH` from dff.core.keywords module.
# Here we can also use keyword `GLOBAL_RESPONSE`, which we have considered in other examples.

# `GRAPH` describes a sub-dialog using linked nodes, each node has the keywords `RESPONSE` and `TRANSITIONS`.

# `RESPONSE` - contains the response that the dialog agent will return when transitioning to this node.
# `TRANSITIONS` - describes transitions from the current node to other nodes.
# `TRANSITIONS` are described in pairs:
#      - the node to which the agent will perform the transition
#      - the condition under which to make the transition
